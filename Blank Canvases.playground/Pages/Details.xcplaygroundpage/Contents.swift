 # Canvas
 
 Mac OS X provides an API for basic grahpics, but it is, I believe, too challenging for beginning programmers to work with.
 
 I developed an abstraction layer, the Canvas class, that, together with auto-complete in Xcode, provides a discoverable, easy-to-use approach to programming with graphics.
 
 The following five playground pages provide "blank canvases" that you can use to begin working with graphics in Swift.
